When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when collaborating with diffrent user or using diffrent machines and need them all synced
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	because not local versions might not always be the version that are ready to be published
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	-fork creates new clone of a repo on your github. used when permission to push/pull is not granted, or want to reuse on a diffrent project.
	-clone creates a local copy of a repo on  local machine. use it when you have push permission.
	-branch is creating a new part of a project that is independent form future updates untill merging is intened. use it when you want to test a new feature or fix a bug.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	it shows the last updated version you have, pointed, and the changes you made afterwords.
